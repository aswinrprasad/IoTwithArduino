### Introduction
A workshop I attended on Internet of things.
+ Worked with Arduino
+ Worked with Waspmote

#### Arduino
    Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.Arduino senses the environment by receiving inputs from many sensors, and affects its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators.

#### Waspmote
    Waspmote is an open source wireless sensor platform specially focused on the implementation of low consumption modes to allow the sensor nodes ("motes") to be completely autonomous and battery powered, offering a variable lifetime between 1 and 5 years depending on the duty cycle and the radio used. Let's know more about how Waspmote was born.
